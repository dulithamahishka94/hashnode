Mastering on how to face an interview is an art. It has a very unique science associated with it. If you can learn the science behind it, nailing interviews will be something like taking a sip of water.

My purpose is not to teach you how to lie in an interview. It is only to leverage the interview to show your specific skill-set and to give you a chance if you truly belong.

One thing to remember! **The person who asks questions, controls the interview.** Always try to keep the ball on your court without giving it to the interviewer.

Let's jump in and see what we can learn today!

Ever found yourself in an interview wishing you could just *nudge* the questions toward the topics you’re prepared to shine in? The good news is, you actually can. It's not about manipulation; it's about guiding the conversation. Think of it like being a strategic conversationalist, skilfully leading the dialogue into areas where you can bring your A-game.

### 1\. **Set the Stage Early: Plant Seeds in Your Resume and Cover Letter**

Have you watched the movie Inception? The movie tells you the value of planting something inside someones mind. The interview actually starts well before you step into the room or join the video call. Your resume and cover letter are your first chance to set the tone and plant seeds. Instead of listing responsibilities in a bland manner, highlight achievements and projects that showcase your best skills. Frame them in a way that teases the interviewer’s curiosity.

For example, instead of saying, “Managed a team of 10,” you could say, “Led a cross-functional team of 10 to complete a high-stakes project that resulted in a 30% increase in customer retention.” This approach not only shows your leadership skills but also invites a follow-up question about the details of that project.

### 2\. **Turn Every Question into an Opportunity to Tell a Story**

Interviewers love stories because they provide context, emotion, and a deeper understanding of your experience. Come prepared with 3-4 stories that highlight your key strengths and align with the job’s requirements. When asked a question, no matter how far it seems from your preferred topic, find a way to link your answer back to one of these stories.

Let’s say you’re asked about handling conflict in a team. You might start with a direct answer, but quickly segue: “That’s a great question. One of the most challenging situations I faced was when I was leading a team through a major product launch. There were significant conflicts about resource allocation, but it also allowed me to use my skills in data analysis to provide objective insights that ultimately helped us make informed decisions…”

Now, you’ve turned a question about conflict resolution into a conversation about your leadership and data skills, subtly nudging the interviewer toward areas where you feel most comfortable.

### 3\. **Use the Power of the Intriguing Pause**

This is a trick borrowed from great storytellers and public speakers. When you mention something compelling, pause briefly. For example: “During my time at Banana Island, I led a project that fundamentally changed our approach to customer engagement…” *Pause.* This brief pause creates a moment of anticipation. The interviewer is likely thinking, “What was the change?” or “How did you do it?” and will naturally ask a follow-up question.

### 4\. **Drop Curiosity Bombs: Create Hooks to Reel Them In**

Another effective strategy is to drop what I call “curiosity bombs.” Mention something fascinating without fully explaining it. For example: “Oh, and that reminds me of the time I implemented an unconventional strategy that saved us nearly $500,000…” Most interviewers will be too intrigued to let that slide without asking you to elaborate.

The trick here is to make sure your curiosity bombs are relevant to the role you're applying for. They should be tailored to the skills or experiences you want to highlight, creating a natural bridge to deeper discussion.

### 5\. **Mirror Their Style and Language**

Have you met someone who has a same vibe as you? People tend to feel more comfortable and engaged when they’re interacting with someone who mirrors their communication style. Pay attention to the interviewer’s tone, pace, and choice of words. If they’re using industry-specific jargon, mirror that language. If they’re casual, don’t hesitate to drop the formality a notch.

Mirroring creates a sense of rapport and makes the interviewer more inclined to stay on topics that align with both your comfort zone and theirs. It’s subtle, but powerful.

### 6\. **Turn Weakness Questions to Your Advantage**

One question you’re almost guaranteed to face is the dreaded, “What’s your biggest weakness?” This is a golden opportunity to pivot to your strengths. For example, “One area I’m working to improve is delegation. I’ve always been someone who dives deep into projects, especially when they involve data analysis or strategy. I realised I was taking on too much myself and not letting my team members showcase their strengths…”

What you’ve done here is mention a “weakness” while immediately bringing the conversation back to your expertise in data analysis or strategy, areas where you want the focus to be.

### 7\. **Ask Questions That Steer the Conversation Back to Your Strengths**

At some point, you’ll be asked, “Do you have any questions for us?” Don’t waste this opportunity. Prepare questions that subtly steer the discussion back to your key skills and experiences.

For example: “I noticed from the job description that you’re looking for someone to help streamline operations. Could you tell me more about what that involves? I recently led an initiative that reduced our time-to-market by 20% through a new process I developed…” Now, you’re not only expressing interest but also opening the door for them to ask how you achieved that.

### 8\. **Use Body Language to Reinforce Your Points**

Body language plays a huge role in communication. When you mention a topic where you’re confident, lean slightly forward, maintain eye contact, and show enthusiasm with your facial expressions. When discussing something less favourable, keep your body relaxed and your gestures open. This non-verbal cueing helps guide the interviewer’s attention and can subtly influence which topics they dwell on.

### 9\. **Reframe the Question if It’s Off-Target**

Sometimes you’ll get a question that feels completely off-base. Instead of panicking, reframe it: “That’s an interesting question. In my experience, a more relevant consideration might be…” Then, steer it towards a topic where you can shine. For example, if asked about a technology you’re less familiar with, pivot to discuss how quickly you’ve picked up new technologies in the past and your passion for continuous learning.

### 10\. **Use Your Close: Summarise Your Strengths with Purpose**

As the interview draws to a close, you usually get a chance to make a final statement. Don’t let this slip by! This is your moment to summarise your key strengths and leave a lasting impression.

Something like: “I really appreciate the chance to speak with you today. I hope I’ve been able to show that I’m not only passionate about data-driven decision-making but also experienced in leading teams through complex challenges, from product launches to strategic shifts in customer engagement. I’m particularly excited about the opportunity to bring these skills to your team and help drive forward the innovative work you’re doing.”

### 11\. **Understand the Interviewer’s Underlying Needs**

Most interviewers are trying to solve a problem, they need someone who can fill a role, address gaps, or drive growth. Make it your job to understand what those underlying needs are. If you sense they’re particularly concerned about a specific area, tailor your responses to address that concern directly. For example, if they’re worried about team dynamics, emphasise your experience in building cross-functional teams and navigating conflict. This approach will naturally guide them to ask more about the areas where you excel.

### 12\. **Be a Conversational Ninja: Stay Present and Flexible**

Lastly, while it’s important to have a plan, you also need to stay present and flexible. Don’t be so fixated on steering the conversation that you miss the chance to respond genuinely to what’s happening in the moment. Being present allows you to pick up on subtle cues from the interviewer and adjust your tactics accordingly. If you notice they’re excited or leaning in when you talk about a particular topic, lean into that. Be ready to adapt, improvise, and find new ways to keep the conversation aligned with your strengths.

### **Article too long? You are almost at the end.**

Remember, this isn’t about *controlling* the conversation; it’s about guiding it with intention. It’s about making sure the interviewer walks away with a clear picture of your best self. The more you practice, the more these techniques will become second nature.

So, the next time you step into an interview, remember: you have the power to subtly influence the direction of the conversation. Go in prepared, confident, and ready to guide the dialogue to your strengths.

As always, Good Luck!
