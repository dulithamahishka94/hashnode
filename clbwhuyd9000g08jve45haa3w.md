# How do you scope a project

Scoping a project in software engineering entails defining the project's boundaries and constraints to establish a clear understanding of what the project will and will not include. Scoping is an important step in the software development process because it ensures that all interested parties have a complete sense of the goals and expectations, and it helps to prevent scope creep, which refers to the tendency for a project's scope to grow over a period.

# What should we consider when scoping a project (In theory)

Scoring a project in software engineering involves several key steps:

1.  Define the project goals and objectives: The first step in project scoping is to establish a clear understanding of what the project is attempting to accomplish. Identifying the business needs or problems that the project is intended to solve, as well as any specific requirements or constraints that must be met, may be part of this process.
    
2.  Identify the stakeholders: It is critical to identify all stakeholders who will be affected by the project as well as those who will be held accountable for its success. The project sponsor, project team, end users, and any other parties with an interest in the project may be included.
    
3.  Define the project scope: Once the project goals and objectives have been established, as well as the stakeholders, the next step is to define the project scope. This could entail identifying the specific features and functionalities that will be included in the project, as well as any constraints or limitations that must be taken into account.
    
4.  Develop a project contract: A project charter is a document that outlines the project's key details, such as the project goals and objectives, project scope, stakeholders, and resources needed to complete the project. Throughout the project, the project charter serves as a reference point, ensuring that all stakeholders are on the same page.
    
5.  Establishing a timeline and budget is an important step in scoping a project because it ensures that the project can be completed within the available resources and constraints. The timeline should include key milestones and deliverables, and the budget should outline the project's costs.
    
6.  Define the roles and duties of all project stakeholders, including the project team, the project sponsor, and any other parties that will be engaged in the project. This helps to ensure that everyone understands what is expected of them and that the project is held accountable.
    
7.  Identify possible risks and issues: Identifying potential risks and issues is a key phase in project scoping because it ensures that the project is well-prepared to deal with any obstacles that may occur. Identifying any risks to the project timing, budget, or scope, as well as any concerns that may affect the project team or stakeholders, may be part of this.
    
8.  As the project continues, it may be important to evaluate and amend the project scope to ensure that it stays relevant and feasible. This may entail altering the project's timeframe, budget, or scope to meet changes or obstacles that emerge.

Yes, it is a lot. What did you expect? An Ice cream?

Overall, scoping a project in software engineering includes identifying stakeholders, defining the project scope, producing a project charter, setting a timeframe and budget, defining project roles and duties, and identifying potential risks and concerns. Following these steps will ensure that a project is well-structured and well-prepared to succeed.

# How do I, or what am I doing to scope and create boundaries when I get a project

1.  Start taking notes: This is the most important part for me. Regardless of what I have with me, I quickly start taking notes. It could be a pen and paper, or one note. Does not matter. The only thing that matters is you taking notes about everything. It should not be a lovely-looking note. It could be an ugly-ass note that only you can understand.
    
2.  List down the entities: This is the second important part of scoping a project. You have to list down however you can, whatever you can. As an example, if it is a project about a shopping cart you have to list down User Management (add/ update users with the roles and permissions), Product Management (add/ update products with their prices and stocks), Shopping cart and obviously a Payment Gateway.
    
3.  Group the entities with their relationship: In here, you have to group those entities and make a relationship between them. This is where you make a rough database structure (not an ER) with the details about how the entities are getting connected and divide them into sections. After this is done, every section would become a milestone. As an example, how the users are getting permissions, what would the structure should be with permissions etc.
    
4.  Start making diagrams: Who does not love pictures and diagrams. Start making the diagrams in this stage. There can be many diagrams. It can be use-case diagrams, flow charts, sequence diagrams or even mindmaps. The more the diagrams, the more you understand the project structure and what to do.
    

After you follow these steps you should be able to get a clear idea about the scope of your project and the boundaries.

There can be many methods of scoping a project. But personally, the above mentioned method suits me. There is no hard and fast rule about scoping a project. Only thing you should think about is, how well you can breakdown the structure for better understanding.

Hope this helps to you to scope your projects, personal or commercial. Comment below if you use or have used any other methods you use to scope projects.

See you soon with another topic!

Bye bye!!
